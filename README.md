# Sleepy
A small remote control I made so I can turn off my PC when I'm in my bed and I'm too lazy to stand up and walk those 1.2 meters

### Setup
1. Create a directory called "sleepy" in your %APPDATA% folder
2. Copy the index.html in the data directory of this repository into the sleepy folder
3. Throw this binary into the autostart folder
4. Maybe modify your firewall rules
5. Access your PC through your local IP address and port from your phone
6. Done!!!
